Advent of Code repository:

Two different years, two different approaches:

2020 (started this one first):
Make a Python library (with unit testing!) & continue in Julia nevertheless

2019: 
Start in Python, remember that you want to learn Haskell (or something more functional languagy), so continue doing that
